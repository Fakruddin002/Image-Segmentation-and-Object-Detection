# 🖼️ Image Segmentation and Object Detection using K-Means Clustering

This project demonstrates how to segment and detect objects in an image using K-Means clustering and basic image processing techniques. It is built as a web application using Streamlit for easy user interaction.

## 🚀 Features

- Upload an image from your local system
- Perform image segmentation using K-Means (k=4)
- Select a specific cluster to highlight
- Mask and convert image to HSV for color filtering
- Detect and draw a bounding box around the largest object
- View all processed images (Original, Segmented, Masked, HSV, Thresholded, Detected)
- Download the final detected image

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Streamlit
- Pillow (PIL)
